                <p class="card-text">
                    The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations
                    are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                    (the
                    start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day
                    (weather
                    permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place
                    the
                    last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans
                    and
                    surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                    parade
                    schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                    earliest,
                    Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for
                    holding
                    large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities
                    as
                    grand
                    marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their
                    Kings),
                    as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
                    traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic
                    beads,
                    doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes
                    follow
                    the
                    same parade schedule and route each year.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                    originate
                    in
                    the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on
                    the
                    upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and
                    Chewbacchus -
                    also
                    take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras
                    day.
                    Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

                    all-female Krewe. Nyx is famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe
                    status since their founding in 2011. Nyx has plummeted in membership and can no longer hold their
                    self proclaimed status as a super krewe.

                    Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade
                    is relatively new, but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its
                    throws (highly sought-after decorated shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians
                    and celebrities.

                    with one of the fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus.[41] There are several smaller
                    neighborhood parades like the Krewe of Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor
                        of New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the
                        office. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council
                        from 2012–2018.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she
                        joined the board of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the
                        association in 2004.[4] After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane
                        Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for months
                        afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by
                        then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New
                        Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the
                        association, Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to organize opposition
                        to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a
                        six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and
                        fellow residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of
                        the Andrew H. Wilson school. She served as a founding board member of the Broadmoor
                        Development Corporation, a community development corporation that provided case management and
                        other social services for returning residents. She was involved with residents' efforts to
                        reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie
                        Endowment.She created a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and
                        Church of the Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood association with office space and
                        hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement
                        Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and
                        Wellness Center.
