                        No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not
                        believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official"
                        Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products
                        or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the
                        government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its
                        merchandise. In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras
                        celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                            Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                            Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year.
                            Fat
                            Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                            The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it
                            will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer
                            your
                            clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                        <p>
                            Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can
                            get
                            somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then
                            you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                        The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is
                        the weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
                        streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers.
                        If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days
                        to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu
                        Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and
                        seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                            By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those
                            of
                            us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue
                            going
                            to every parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags
                            (even
                            large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys,
                            stuffed animals, beads, and more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades
                            pass
                            anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon
                            since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion
                            of
                            St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade
                            watching
                            position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You
                            don't
                            have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like
                            Metairie,
                            which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday
                            before
                            Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                            many of our larger parades the last two weeks of Mardi Gras season:

                            inner-city neighborhoods. Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at
                            the
                            corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of
                            Zulu
                            passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu
                            parade.

                            March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at
                            Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their
                            feathers
                            and suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."

                        There is a city ordinance in Orleans Parish that prohibits Mardi Gras from being commercialized,
                        i.e., no advertising is allowed on floats or can be thrown from floats. In addition, some of the
                        Mardi Gras organizations have events outside of their actual parade where sponsors can
                        participate. These include Zulu’s Lundi Gras Festival, Endymion’s big bash before their parade,
                        Metairie’s “Family Gras”, and the ticketed extravaganzas held after some of our parades (such as
                        Bacchus, Endymion, Orpheus).
